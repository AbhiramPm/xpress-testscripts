        // Test Scenario 52: Test if the user can view the videos added to the page
        // Automated testing may not validate the video content; manual inspection is often necessary.

        videoPlayer.click(); // Assuming clicking on the video toggles play/pause
        // Add verification for the expected behavior, e.g., checking the state of the video player

        // Test Scenario 54: Test that the videos contain corresponding icons for playing and pausing
        // Verify the presence of play/pause icons in the video player controls

        // Test Scenario 55: Test the forward and backward functionality in the video streaming player while streaming
        // Perform actions to move forward and backward in the video, and add verification for the expected behavior

        // Test Scenario 56: Verify that after using the forward or backward functionality, the video playing speed should not change
        // Automated testing may not precisely measure playing speed; manual inspection may be required.

        // Test Scenario 57: Verify that after using the forward or backward functionality, the audio listening speed should not change or lag/lead
        // Automated testing may not precisely measure audio speed; manual inspection may be required.

        // Test Scenario 58: Ensure that the voice of the video is not interrupted while streaming with different speeds of the internet connection
        // Simulate different internet speeds and verify that the video audio remains uninterrupted

        // Test Scenario 59: Test that the streaming video should be adjustable according to the video streaming player’s screen sizes
        // Test video resizing based on different screen sizes and verify the expected behavior

        // Test Scenario 60: Test that if the connection is lost while streaming the video, then video buffering should be stopped with an internet connection lost message
        // Simulate internet disconnection during video streaming and verify the expected behavior

        // Test Scenario 61: Verify that the video streaming player retains the video’s last position for resume if the video is paused
        // Pause the video, navigate away, and return to verify that the video resumes from the last position

        // Test Scenario 62: Test that the video contains a proper close button or the video should be closed when clicked outside of the video
        // Verify the presence of a close button or simulate clicking outside the video to close it

        // Image Testing
        // Assuming the following HTML structure for image elements:
        // <img id="mainImage" src="image.jpg" alt="Main Image">
        WebElement mainImage = driver.findElement(By.id("mainImage"));

        // Test Scenario 63: Test that the images are placed correctly on the page
        // Automated testing may verify the presence and positioning of images, but manual inspection is often necessary.

        // Test Scenario 64: Test that the image carousel is working correctly
        // Assuming an image carousel with navigation buttons, test the functionality and verify the expected behavior

        // Test Scenario 65: Test that the image carousel can be closed
        // Verify the presence of a close button for the image carousel or simulate closing it and verify the expected behavior

        // Close the browser
